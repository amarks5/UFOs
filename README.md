# UFOs
## Overview:
We were to make a webpage and dynamic table to store information about UFO sightings. We applied multiple ways for the users to filter through the sightings i.e. city, state, country or even shape. I personally like the idea of having so many ways for the users to filter through the data because often times we can't remember the date of an event. However, I could remember the location of where I might have seen a UFO.
## Results:
Upon visiting the webpage users will be welcoming with a picture of outerspace at the top followed by a short blurb from our Ufologist (see below)

There are numerous ways users can accomplish a search for a UFO sighting. They could look by the date of the sighting, city where they saw it, state they were in, country or even shape. These are all incredibly helpful ways to search because often times I don't even know where I was on a certain date so having the option of looking them up by other criteria is beneficial for the user.
