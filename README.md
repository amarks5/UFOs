# UFOs
## Overview:
We were to make a webpage and dynamic table to store information about UFO sightings. We applied multiple ways for the users to filter through the sightings i.e. city, state, country or even shape. I personally like the idea of having so many ways for the users to filter through the data because often times we can't remember the date of an event. However, I could remember the location of where I might have seen a UFO.
## Results:
Upon visiting the webpage users will be welcoming with a picture of outerspace at the top followed by a short blurb from our Ufologist (see below)

There are numerous ways users can accomplish a search for a UFO sighting. They could look by the date of the sighting, city where they saw it, state they were in, country or even shape. These are all incredibly helpful ways to search because often times I don't even know where I was on a certain date so having the option of looking them up by other criteria is beneficial for the user.

## Summary:
We were able to create a user friendly webpage that has stored the UFO Sightings information. This webpage allows users to filter through all of the UFO Sightings by different criteria including date, city, state, country and shape. However, we are not exactly able to fact check these sightings. Are these sightings just based on a single person reporting them? It would be beneficial to have a description of the siting as in how many people were present. Additionally, I think we could add two more filters for this webpage being duration of sighting and time of day for the sighting.
